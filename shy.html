<h1>SHY STORY</h1>

Hi I'am Shei Czyreen E. Cantre from Talumpok Silangan. Batangas. I'am a first year college in Batangas State University, 18 year old and here's my story<br><br>
My life is complicated,my struggle is very hard, my family is now in a trouble, and  ilose myself. For me the life I'm going thru is a very tough struggle that anyone in my ordeal would go through.Because my mother treats me where there is someone in front of me who is very kind to other people, the story I have in my life is not right, so when she turns her back, it is very bad for me But no matter what he does at a time where I hurt him and even my relatives, someone loves me and they love me. No matter how much my mother is with me, somehow, I really love it. Parents, of course, are always just what I do. Challenges are what make  my life interesting. Overcoming that is what makes  life meaningful.
 <br><br>
What I have learned is that you still have to face what you don't want and want, even though the world is round, even though you turn your back on the issue, because it will teach you how courageous you are and how you will resist the trials you are going to go through. The most beautfulting in this world is to see my parents smiling  ang knowing that Iam the reasons  behind that smile. Thats what i learned
